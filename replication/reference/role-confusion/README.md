# Reproducing Role-Confusion Linear Probes

This repository prepares a probe-only reproduction of [*Prompt Injection as
Role Confusion*](https://arxiv.org/abs/2603.12277), following the authors'
[`gpt-oss-20b` demonstration](https://github.com/role-confusion/prompt-injection-as-role-confusion/blob/master/demo/role-probe-demo.ipynb).

The experiment places identical neutral text under different genuine chat
roles, extracts token activations, and trains a linear classifier to recover the
role. It then applies the probe where writing style and architectural role
disagree.

## What can run where

On an Apple Silicon or other non-NVIDIA laptop:

- edit code and notebooks;
- use Git/GitHub with a collaborator;
- validate role rendering and dataset bookkeeping;
- inspect saved CSV results and create plots.

On the remote NVIDIA H100:

- install CUDA, CuPy, and RAPIDS cuML;
- load `openai/gpt-oss-20b`;
- extract hidden states;
- train and apply the GPU probes.

No NVIDIA GPU is required for the local checks. The H100 provides compute, not
version control: collaborators should continue to exchange code through GitHub.

## Token-level Assistant Axis viewer

The local viewer decrypts the completed GPT-OSS CoT-forgery trajectories and
source responses in memory, then lets you inspect the Assistant Axis projection
at every prompt and generated token. It binds only to `127.0.0.1`, uses a fresh
session capability in the URL, disables browser caching, and serves one selected
pair at a time.

With the encrypted files in `data/projection-viewer/` and the owner-held keys in
their recorded locations, run:

```bash
python3 scripts/serve_projection_viewer.py
```

The browser opens automatically. Use `--no-open` to print the private local URL
without opening it, or `--port PORT` to choose a fixed loopback port.

The upstream snapshot is pinned to commit
`ec333c40fd43fe991e1ebf66765051b6d7e35784`. Its provenance and license are in
[`vendor/upstream/PROVENANCE.md`](vendor/upstream/PROVENANCE.md).

## Run the local preparation checks

The checks support the macOS system Python 3.9+ and install nothing:

```bash
python3 scripts/check_local.py
```

This command:

1. regenerates `demo/role-probe-demo.ipynb` from the pinned upstream copy;
2. validates the notebook JSON;
3. tests all five Harmony role renderings;
4. verifies identifiers needed for leakage-safe grouped splitting.

It intentionally does not download a model or pretend to validate CUDA.

## Configuration

`.env` is present locally and ignored by Git. `.env.example` documents shared
variable names without containing secrets:

```dotenv
HF_TOKEN=
ROLE_PROBE_STORAGE_ROOT=/workspace/role-probe-storage
HF_HOME=/workspace/role-probe-storage/huggingface
ROLE_PROBE_OUTPUT_DIR=/workspace/role-probe-storage/outputs
ROLE_PROBE_MODEL_REVISION=6cee5e81ee83917806bbde320786a8fb61efebee
ROLE_PROBE_C4_REVISION=f3b95a11ff318ce8b651afc7eb8e7bd2af469c10
ROLE_PROBE_N_SAMPLES=150
ROLE_PROBE_BATCH_SIZE=32
ROLE_PROBE_SPLIT_GROUP=prompt_ix
```

The generated notebook loads `.env`; it contains no hard-coded cache directory
or API key.

## Baseline settings

- Model: `openai/gpt-oss-20b`
- Model revision: `6cee5e81ee83917806bbde320786a8fb61efebee`
- Source sequences: 150, split between C4 and Dolma 3
- C4 revision: `f3b95a11ff318ce8b651afc7eb8e7bd2af469c10`
- Dolma 3 revision: `3a8349c` (as pinned upstream)
- Maximum content length: 512 tokens
- Probe layers: `0, 4, 8, 12, 16, 20`
- Seed: 123
- Probe roles: `system`, `user`, `cot`, `assistant`
- Classifier: L2 logistic regression, `C=5e-3`, 2,000 iterations
- H100 batch size: 32

Start with 10 sequences and batch size 1 as a smoke test. Restore the baseline
only after the full pipeline works.

For the paper-sized training set, use 250 sequences, a maximum content length
of 1,024, and reduce the H100 batch size to 16:

```bash
ROLE_PROBE_N_SAMPLES=250 \
ROLE_PROBE_MAX_SEQLEN=1024 \
ROLE_PROBE_BATCH_SIZE=16 \
ROLE_PROBE_OUTPUT_DIR=/workspace/role-probe-storage/outputs/full-paper-size \
python scripts/run_probe.py
```

After training, reproduce the gardening tag-conflict plot with:

```bash
python scripts/evaluate_tag_conditions.py
```

This evaluates the published conversation in `data/gardening-conversation.yaml`
with correct tags, no tags, and the whole transcript wrapped in user tags. It
saves token-level role probabilities, summaries, and a CoTness plot under the
persistent output directory. Set `ROLE_PROBE_TAG_LAYER=16` for the strongest
layer in our lightweight run; the paper's mid-layer plot corresponds to layer
12.

## Important split distinction

The upstream demo splits by `prompt_ix`, where every role-rendered copy has a
different ID. This permits identical source text across train and test. Use
`ROLE_PROBE_SPLIT_GROUP=prompt_ix` for direct demo comparability, then rerun
with `base_seq_ix` so all role copies remain together. Report the grouped result
as a separate robustness check.

High probe accuracy establishes linear decodability; it does not by itself show
that the model causally uses the probe direction to follow instructions.

## Proposed extension: role confusion and persona drift

A natural next question is whether confusion about conversational role
destabilizes the model's default Assistant persona. This connects the role
probes in this repository with Lu et al.'s
[*The Assistant Axis*](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10387), which identifies a
direction in activation space measuring how much a model is operating in its
default Assistant mode.

The proposed causal hypothesis is:

```text
role confusion -> movement along the Assistant Axis -> persona drift or harmful behavior
```

This should be compared against alternatives in which architectural role and
persona are independent, share a representation without a causal relationship,
or respond separately to the same adversarial content.

### Recommended first model

Start with `Qwen/Qwen3-32B` and train new role probes for it, rather than first
constructing an Assistant Axis for `gpt-oss-20b`. Lu et al. provide a
precomputed Qwen3-32B Assistant Axis, persona vectors, and activation-capping
settings in their
[`assistant-axis` repository](https://github.com/safety-research/assistant-axis).
Constructing a faithful new axis would additionally require generating and
judging responses for a large collection of personas, extracting their
activations, and validating the resulting direction behaviorally.

The first Qwen experiment should use only the unambiguous architectural roles
`system`, `user`, and `assistant`. Qwen's thinking region should not initially
be treated as a separate architectural role analogous to GPT-OSS's Harmony
analysis channel. The role-confusion upstream repository supports the related
`Qwen3-30B-A3B`, so its full role-analysis workflow may provide useful Qwen
rendering and token-labeling code, but the dense Qwen3-32B adaptation still
needs to be validated.

### Initial experiments

1. Load the published Qwen3-32B Assistant Axis and reproduce basic projection
   results with reasoning disabled.
2. Render identical neutral passages under genuine system, user, and assistant
   roles, keeping all copies of a passage in the same train/test group.
3. Extract activations using exactly the same residual-stream location and
   layer convention as the Assistant Axis implementation.
4. Train linear role probes and also compute a simple architectural direction,
   `mean(assistant) - mean(user)`, for direct geometric comparison with the
   Assistant Axis.
5. Measure cosine similarity, principal angles, cross-projection, and whether
   either signal remains decodable after projecting out the other subspace.
6. Apply role-confusion examples and test whether the role-confusion signal
   precedes movement away from the Assistant end of the axis.
7. Run a causal 2-by-2 intervention: role-representation repair on/off crossed
   with Assistant-Axis activation capping on/off. This can distinguish an
   upstream role-confusion mechanism from a downstream persona-drift mediator.

For a first H100 run, use batch size 1, short passages, and layer 32, which Lu
et al. designate as the Qwen3-32B target layer. Retain only selected layers and
move saved activations to CPU promptly because the dense BF16 model leaves
limited memory headroom on an 80 GB GPU.

After establishing the result on Qwen3-32B, a smaller persona panel can be used
to construct and validate a GPT-OSS Assistant Axis as a cross-model extension.

## Remote execution

Follow [`docs/H100_RUNBOOK.md`](docs/H100_RUNBOOK.md) when compute is available.
It covers SSH, persistent storage, installation, Jupyter tunneling, smoke tests,
the baseline, result preservation, and stopping billing.

To execute only the probe-training section without opening Jupyter or running
the later API-backed attack cells:

```bash
./.venv/bin/python scripts/run_probe.py
```

The pinned upstream snapshot has a dependency inconsistency: the notebook
demands Transformers 5 while its setup script pins 4.57.5. The local H100 setup
follows the notebook (`transformers>=5,<6`) and records the installed version.
Note this with the final results.

## Collaboration workflow

Use normal Git branches on both laptops and the H100:

```bash
git pull --ff-only
git switch -c your-name/short-task
# edit and test
git add README.md scripts src tests
git commit -m "Describe the change"
git push -u origin your-name/short-task
```

Do not commit `.env`, model caches, activations, notebooks containing secrets,
or generated probe pickles. Keep large artifacts on the persistent volume and
commit small summary tables only when intentionally reviewed.
